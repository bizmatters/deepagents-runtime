# Three types of dependencies based on CI stages
dependencies:
  # Platform services (checked in platform readiness)
  # Foundation services (external-secrets, crossplane-operator, cnpg, foundation-config) are always deployed
  # Only declare optional services that your service actually uses
  platform:
    - nats                   # NATS messaging platform (required for agent communication)
    - keda                   # KEDA autoscaling platform (required for scaling agents)
    - apis
    
  # External services (deployed before this service)
  external: 
    - neon-db  # Neon DB API calls
  
  # Internal services (validated after deployment)
  internal:
    - redis                  # Validates deepagents-runtime-cache (Dragonfly)
    - nats-streams          # Validates NATS streams and consumers
    - keda-scaler           # Validates KEDA ScaledObject
